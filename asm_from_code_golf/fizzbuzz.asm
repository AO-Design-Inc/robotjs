// This program makes extensive use of a number format that I call
// "high-decimal". This is a version of decimal where the digit 0 is
// encoded as the byte 246, the digit 1 as the byte 247, ..., the
// digit 9 as the byte 255. The bytes are stored in the normal
// endianness for the processor (i.e. least significant first), and
// padded to a known length (typically 8 digits) with leading zeroes.
//
// The point of high-decimal is that it allows us to use arithmetic
// operators intended for binary on high-decimal numbers, and the
// carries will work the same way (i.e. the same digits will carry,
// although carries will be 0-based rather than 246-based); all that's
// required is to identify the digits that carried and add 246 to
// them. That means that the processor's binary ALU can be used to do
// additions directly in decimal - there's no need for loops or
// anything like that, and no need to do binary/decimal conversions.
//
// The first use for high-decimal is to store the line number during
// the second phase (it's stored differently in the third phase).

///// The output routine
//
// Most FizzBuzz routines produce output with `write` or a similar
// system call, but these have the disadvantage that they need to copy
// the data being output from userspace into kernelspace. It turns out
// that when running full speed (as seen in the third phase), FizzBuzz
// actually runs faster than `memcpy` does, so `write` and friends are
// unusable when aiming for performance - this program runs five times
// faster than an equivalent that uses `write`-like system calls.
//
// To produce output without losing speed, the program therefore needs
// to avoid copies, or at least do them in parallel with calculating
// the next block of output. This can be accomplished with the
// `vmsplice` system call, which tells the kernel to place a reference
// to a buffer into a pipe (as opposed to copying the data into the
// pipe); the program at the other end of this pipe will then be able
// to read the output directly out of this program's memory, with no
// need to copy the data into kernelspace and then back into
// userspace. In fact, it will be reading out of this program's
// processor's L2 cache, without main memory being touched at all;
// this is the secret to high-performance programming, because the
// cache is much faster than main memory is.
//
// Of course, it's therefore important to avoid changing the output
// buffer until the program connected to standard output has actually
// read it all. This is why the pipe size needed to be set earlier; as
// long as the amount of output is always at least as large as the
// pipe size, successfully outputting one buffer will ensure that none
// of the other buffer is left in the pipe, and thus it's safe to
// overwrite the memory that was previosuly output. There is some need
// to jump through hoops later on to make sure that `swap_buffers` is
// never called with less than one pipeful of data, but it's worth it
// to get the huge performance boost.

// The third phase operates primarily using a bytecode interpreter; it
// generates a program in "FizzBuzz bytecode", for which each byte of
// bytecode generates one byte of output. The bytecode language is
// designed so that it can be interpreted using SIMD instructions; 32
// bytes of bytecode can be loaded from memory, interpreted, and have
// its output stored back into memory using just four machine
// instructions. This makes it possible to speed up the FizzBuzz
// calculations by hardcoding some of the calculations into the
// bytecode (this is similar to how JIT compilers can create a version
// of the program with some variables hardcoded, and throw it away on
// the rare occasions that those variables' values change).

// This program aims to output 64 bytes of output per four clock
// cycles, which it achieves via a continuous stream of 32-byte writes
// calculated by the bytecode program. One major complication here is
// that the 32-byte writes won't correspond to lines of FizzBuzz; a
// single processor instruction may end up outputting multiple
// different line numbers. So it's no longer possible to have a simple
// line number register, like it was in the second phase.
//
// Instead, the program stores an *approximation* of the line number,
// which is never allowed to differ by 100 or more from the "actual"
// line number; the bytecode program is responsible for fixing up the
// approximation to work out the correct line number to output (this
// allows the same CPU instruction to output digits from multiple
// different line numbers, because the bytecode is being interpreted
// in a SIMD way and thus different parts of the bytecode can fix the
// line number up differently within a single instruction.
//
// The line number is split over three processor registers:
// - LINENO_LOW: stores the line number modulo 200
// - LINENO_MID: stores the hundreds to billions digits
// - LINENO_TOP: stores the ten-billions and more significant digits
// (The parity of the 100s digit is duplicated between LINENO_MID and
// LINENO_LOW; this allows a faster algorithm for LINENO_MID updates.)
//
// Because there's only a need to be within 100 of the real line
// number, the algorithm for updating the line numbers doesn't need to
// run all that often (saving processor cycles); it runs once every
// 512 bytes of output, by simply adding a precalculated value
// (LINENO_LOW_INCR) to LINENO_LOW, then processing the carry to
// LINENO_MID (see later for LINENO_TOP). The amount by which the line
// number increases per 512 bytes of output is not normally going to
// be an integer; LINENO_LOW is therefore stored as a 64-bit fixpoint
// number (in which 2**64 represents "200", e.g. 2**63 would be the
// representation of "the line number is 100 mod 200"), in order to
// delay the accumulation of rounding errors as long as possible. It's
// being stored in a vector register, so there are four copies of its
// value; two of them have 50 (i.e 2**62) added, and two of them have
// 50 subtracted, in order to allow for more efficient code to handle
// the carry to LINENO_MID. Additionally, LINENO_LOW is interpreted as
// a signed number (an older version of this program was better at
// checking for signed than unsigned overflow and I had no reason to
// change).
//
// LINENO_LOW and LINENO_MID are reset every LINENO_WIDTH increase
// (this is because the program can calculate "past" the width
// increase due to not being able to break out of every instruction of
// the main loop, which may cause unwanted carries into LINENO_MID and
// force a reset).

// Generating the bytecode program
//
// The bytecode format is very simple (in order to allow it to be
// interpreted in just a couple of machine instructions):
// - A negative byte represents a literal character (e.g. to produce
//   a literal 'F', you use the bytecode -'F', i.e. -70 = 0xba)
// - A byte 0..7 represents the hundreds..billions digit of the line
//   number respectively, and asserts that the hundreds digit of the
//   line number is even
// - A byte 8..15 represents the hundreds..billions digit of the line
//   number respectively, and asserts that the hundreds digit of the
//   line number is odd
//
// In other words, the bytecode program only ever needs to read from
// LINENO_MID; the information stored in LINENO_LOW and LINENO_TOP
// therefore has to be hardcoded into it. The program therefore needs
// to be able to generate 600 lines of output (as the smallest number
// that's divisible by 100 to be able to hardcode the two low digits,
// 200 to be able to get the assertions about the hundreds digits
// correct, and 3 and 5 to get the Fizzes and Buzzes in the right
// place).

// %ymm2 holds the bytecode for outputting the hundreds and more

// from 198 (i.e. 256 - 10 - '0'). The constant parts of LINENO_TOP
// are 198 minus the bytecode for outputting the hundreds to billions

// The main loop

// The bytecode interpreter consists of four instructions:
// 1. Load the bytecode from memory into %ymm2;
// 2. Use it as a shuffle mask to shuffle LINENO_MID_TEMP;
// 3. Subtract the bytecode from the shuffle result;
// 4. Output the result of the subtraction.
//
// To see why this works, consider two cases. If the bytecode wants to
// output a literal character, then the shuffle will produce 0 for
// that byte (in AVX2, a shuffle with a a negative index produces an
// output of 0), and subtracting the bytecode from 0 then produces the
// character (because the bytecode encoded minus the character). If
// the bytecode instead wants to output a digit, then the shuffle will
// fetch the relevant digit from LINENO_MID_TEMP (which is the desired
// ASCII character plus the bytecode instruction that produces it),
// and subtract the bytecode instruction to just produce the character
// on its own.
//
// This produces an exactly correct line number as long as the line
// number approximation is within 100 of the true value: it will be
// correct as long as the relevant part of LINENO_MID is correct, and
// the worst case is for LINENO_MID to be storing, say, 200 and 300
// (the representation of 250) when the true line number is 400. The
// value in LINENO_MID specifically can be up to 50 away from the
// value of the line number as recorded by LINENO_MID and LINENO_LOW
// together, so as long as the line number registers are within 100,
// LINENO_MID will be within 150 (which is what is required).
//
// This doesn't update the bytecode instruction pointer or the pointer
// into the output buffer; those are updated once every 512 bytes (and
// to "advance the instruction pointer" the rest of the time, the main
// loop is unrolled, using hardcoded offsets with the pointer updates
// baked in).
//
// The bytecode instruction pointer itself is read from %rdx, not
// BYTECODE_IP, so that mid-loop arithmetic on BYTECODE_IP won't cause
// the interpreter to break.
//
// It's important to note one potential performance issue with this
// code: the read of the bytecode from memory is not only misalignable
// (`vmovdqu`); it splits a cache line 3/8 of the time. This causes L1
// split-load penalties on the 3/8 cycles where it occurs. I am not
// sure whether this actually reduces the program's performance in
// practice, or whether the split loads can be absorbed while waiting
// for writes to go through to the L2 cache. However, even if it does
// have a genuine performance cost, it seems like the least costly way
// to read the bytecode; structuring the bytecode to avoid split loads
// makes it take up substantially more memory, and the less cache that
// is used for the bytecode, the more that can be used for the output
// buffers. (In particular, increasing the bytecode to 2400 lines so
// that it's available at all four of the alignments required of it
// does not gain, because it then becomes so large that the processor
// struggles to keep it in L1 cache - it only just fits, and there
// isn't any way for it to know which parts of the cache are meant to
// stay in L1 and which are meant to leave to L2, so there's a large
// slowdown when it guesses wrong.)

// the 10-billions and higher digits to need to change in the middle
// of a main loop iteration - indeed, even in the middle of a single
// CPU instruction!
//
// It turns out that when discussing the line number registers above,
// I lied a little about the format. The bottom seven bytes of
// LINENO_MID do indeed represent the hundreds to hundred millions
// digits. However, the eighth changes in meaning over the course of
// the program. It does indeed represent the billions digit most of
// the time; but when the line number is getting close to a multiple
// of 10 billion, the billions and hundred-millions digits will always
// be the same as each other (either both 9s or both 0s). When this
// happens, the format changes: the hundred-millions digit of
// LINENO_MID represents *both* the hundred-millions and billions
// digits of the line number, and the top byte then represents the
// ten-billions digit. Because incrementing a number causes a row of
// consecutive 9s to either stay untouched, or all roll over to 0s at
// once, this effectively lets us do maths on more than 8 digits,
// meaning that the normal arithmetic code within the main loop can
// handle the ten-billions digit in addition to the digits below.
//
// Of course, the number printing code also needs to handle the new
// representation, but the number printing is done by a bytecode
// program, which can be made to output some of the digits being
// printed multiple times by repeating "print digit from LINENO_MID"
// commands within it. Those commands are generated from COUNTER_TOP
// anyway, so the program just changes the constant portion of
// COUNTER_TOP (and moves print-digit commands into the top half) in
// order to produce the appropriate bytecode changes.
//
// A similar method is used to handle carries in the hundred-billions,
// trillions, etc. digits.
//
// Incidentally, did you notice the apparent off-by-one in the
// initialisation of LINENO_MID within third_phase_per_width_init? It
// causes the "billions" digit to be initialised to 1 (not 0) when the
// line number width is 11 or higher. That's because the alternate
// representation will be in use during a line number width change (as
// higher powers of 10 are close to multiples of 10 billion), so the
// digit that's represented by that byte of LINENO_MID genuinely is a
// 1 rather than a 0.

// a) The line number is in normal format, and the hundred-millions

// b) The line number is in alternate format, and the hundred-millions

// To avoid branchy code in the common case (when no format change is
